Your NetID is typically your initials and a numeric digit. That's
what we need here.

## Problem 1
- Scenario: TSA
- Assumptions:
  - Current security inspection machines has the ability to detect common items that are forbidden on flights, such as the existence of liquid over 100ml, sharp items, lighters and other kinds of flammable and combustible.
- Assets:
  - The safety and well-being of passengers on flights
  - The reputation of the airline and the airport, as well as peopleâ€™s level of trust towards using planes as a means of transportation
  - The security of the nation (when defending against terrorist hijacking planes)
- Threats:
  - People may try to bring weapons (e.g. sharp items, liquid bombs) on flight and use it for dangerous purposes, for example hijacking a plane 
  - Passengers may carry forbidden items unintentionally
  - Drug dealers may try to bring drugs or raw materials to produce drugs
  - Passengers carrying infectious diseases unknowingly
- Countermeasures:
  - Each person needs to go through one round of security check before boarding. All the baggages are inspected by machines and each person also has to go inside a machine to check for dangerous personal belongings.
    - cost: designing and building the appropriate machineries could be expensive and the implementation of it in the airport can be troublesome; hiring and training staff to assist in the process is also time-consuming
    - benefit: In general, most of the forbidden items can be detect by machines
  
  In general, I think this countermeasure if rather effective, because once the appropriate machineries are set up, it is almost impossible to take forbidden items onboard a flight, whether intentionally or unintentionally. The corresponding cost of building and setting up the system is thus worthwhile.
  - To deal with infectious diseases, there can be a body temperature check for all passengers as part of the inspection process. Additional health check should be performed for passengers who have just been to certain dangerous places or countries
    - cost: building appropriate machineries and setting it up in a space in the airport; hiring additional health professionals
    - Benefit: can detect passengers with abnormal body temperature and reduce the probability of people carrying infectious diseases from entering
  
  This countermeasure is less effective than the previous one. Not all infectious diseases will cause abnormal body temperature, and the effectiveness of doing additional checks relies on the person being honest about the places he or she recently visited. It is difficult to define what kind of places are dangerous, so some people would not know that they should do a health check. However, this countermeasure does deal with infectious diseases to some extent, and the cost of it is understandable, so I think it is still a justifiable countermeasure.
